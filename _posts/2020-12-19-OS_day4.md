#### Operating System Structure <br>

#### MS-DOS

- written to provide the most functionality in the least space
- not divided into modules
- its interfaces and levels of functionality are not well separated
- allow applications to access HW access
- no user- and kernel- mode separation

- Single-tasking, single memory space
- Shell (command interpreter) invoked when system booted
- Simple method to run program (loads program into memory, overwriting all include small part of CI)
- Program exit -> the remaining CI reloads shell from disk

#### Layered Approach
![layer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/102725468-4e9d9580-435a-11eb-86c9-6bdb7f953e41.JPG)
- The operating system is divided into a number of layers
- The bottom layer is the hardware, the highest layer is the user interace
- Layers are selected such that each layer uses functions (operations) and services of only lower-level layers

#### Traditional UNIX System Structure

- consists of everything below the system call interface and above the physial hardware
- provides a large number of functions for one level
  - file system, CPU scheduling, memory management, I/O, ...
- Pros : Performance
- Cons 
  - Difficult to maintain and upgrade due to interdependencies in the code
  - Security / reliability
    - Any component of OS can ruin entire system
    - Entire OS code runs in a single memory space
