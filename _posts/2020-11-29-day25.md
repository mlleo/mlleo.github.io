### Face recognition

- Face verification (1:1 problem)
  - Input image, name / ID 
  - Output whether the input image is that of the claimed person

- Face recognition (1:K problem)
  - Has a database of K persons
  - Get an input image
  - Output ID if the image is any of the K persons (or "not recognized")

**Design high performance face verification model, then use it to face recognition!** 

#### Problem of face recognition (one-shot learning)

- Most face recognition applications need to be able to recognize a person given just one single image, or given just one example of that person's face.
- Deep learning algorithms don't work well if you have only one training example. (if you have such a small training set it is really not enough to train a robust neural network for this task)

#### Solution of one-shot learning

- Learning a "similarity" function
- d(img1, img2) = degree of difference between images
- If d(img1, img2) <= a(hyperparameter) -> "same" person (verification), d(img1, img2) > a(hyperparameter) -> "different" person (verification)
- In face recognition problem, compare all pairs of d(img1, img2) then output the most high probability label.
