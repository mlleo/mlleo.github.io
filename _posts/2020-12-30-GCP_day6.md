#### Why Google
- There are over 4,000 Tensorflow machine learning modesls in production at Google
![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103310750-aa9fa280-4a5b-11eb-9ac1-cc0a1f52f78d.png)

#### Why Google Cloud
- To be successful at ML, you need to think not just about creating models, but also about serving out ML predictions
![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103310766-b4290a80-4a5b-11eb-9cb6-f895204ce7d0.png)

- On GCP, the key services are all serverless and they're all managed infrastructure
- By building data pipelines in Google Cloud, you essentially get to take advantage of the **scalability, reliability, and sheer engineering progress that Google brings to running machine learning systems**![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103310750-aa9fa280-4a5b-11eb-9ac1-cc0a1f52f78d.png)

#### Review Question
1. What is a common reason for an ML model that works well in training but fails in production?
- The ML dataset was improperly created
2. Personalized Algorithms are often built using which type of ML model?
- Recommendation systems
3. What is a key lesson Google has learned with regards to reducing the chance of failure in production ML models?
- Process batch data and streaming data the same way

#### AI VS Machine Learning
- AI is a discipline, it has to do with the theory and methods to build machines think & act like humans
- Machine Learning is a toolset, so we can use machine learning to solve certain kinds of AI problems

#### Two stages of AI
1. Train an ML model with examples
![train](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103311246-264e1f00-4a5d-11eb-8199-d0519c280b5c.png)

2. Inference (Predict with a trained model)

![total](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103311248-26e6b580-4a5d-11eb-919b-51fe3986b1d4.png)

#### ML in Google product
![product](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103314602-eb50e900-4a66-11eb-94de-ece0fc80feda.png)

- ML is part of pretty much every Google product
- In practice, you will have to build many ML modles to solve one problem
- EX. How to forecast whether an item will go out of stock
  - First model to predict demand for the product at the store location
  - Second model to predict the inventory of this item at the supplier's warehouses and nearby tores
  - Third model to predict how long it is going to take them to stock the product and use this to predict which supplier you will ask to refill, and when
  - etc...

#### Review Question
1. The main stages of Machine Learning models are?
- Train an ML model
- Predict with a trained model
2. What are common mathematical models used in Machine Learning?
- Linear methods
- Decision Trees
- Radial basis functions
3. In the past, why did neural networks models have just a few layers?
- Neural networks with lots of layers takes a lot of computing power
- As you add more layers, there are more weights to adjust, and you need lots more data available to make those adjustments
- If you just add layers, you may run into issues, for example some of the layers may become all zero or blow up and become NAM (not a number)
4. What are the models included in Google Translate app?
- Find the sign
- Read the sign
- Detect the language
5. What is the smart reply feature of Inbox and Gmail?
- The email program suggests three possible responses to received emails

#### Pre-trained models
- There are variety of domains where Google exposes ML services trained with their own data
![model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103318194-fd378980-4a70-11eb-8810-3f13ffeb7ea3.JPG)
- Two ways that Google Cloud Platform can help you add Machine learning to your applications
  - tools to help you build custom machine-learning models
    - Tensorflow lets you build and train your own machine learning models, using your own data
    - If you want to run tensorflow models on managed Google infrastructure, use Cloud Machine Learning Engine 
  - friendly machine learning (pre-trained APIs)
    - give you access to pre-trained machine learning models, with a single REST API request

#### Vision API in action
- Cloud Vision is an API that lets you perform complex image detection with a single rest API request
- label and Web detection
  - tell you what is this a picture of
  - search for similar images across the web and extract content from the pages where those images are found to return additional details on your image
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
  - extract text from the images   
  - tell you where that text was found
  - tell you what language that text is in
- Logo Detection
  - identify company logos in an image
- Landmark Detection
  - tell if an image contains a common landmark
  - provide the latitude-longitude coordinates of that landmark
- Crop hints
  - crop your photos to focus on a particular subject
#### Video Intelligence API
- Label detection
  - tells you what's in this video
  - At a high level, it'll tell you what is your video about
  - In a more granular level, it can tell you what's happening in every scene of your video
- Shot change detection
  - if your video changes from a landscape pan to a close-up of a person doing an interview, it'll give you the timestamps every time the camera changes shots
- Explicit content detection
  - identify inappropriate scenes in your video
- Regionalization
  - specify the region where your video API requests should be executed
  
#### Cloud Speech-to-Text API
- Cloud speech is an API that let's you perform speech to text transcription in over 100 languages
- Speech-to-text transcription
  - lets you pass it in audio file and it returns a text transcription of that file
- Speech timestamps
  - it will return the start and end time for every word in your audio transcription, which makes it really easy to search within your audio
- Profanity filtering
- Perform either batch or streaming transcription

#### Cloud Translation API
- API that let's you translate text into over 100 different languages
- Translate text
- Detect the language of your text

#### Cloud Natural Language API
- Cloud Natural Language is an API that let's you understand texts with a single rest API request
- Extract entities
- Detect sentiment
- Analyze syntax
- Classify content

#### Cloud Text-to-Speech API
- Cloud Text-to-Speech is an API that lets you convert text into human-like speech
- pass it to text file and it returns raw audio data as a base64 encoded string
- You must decode this base64 encoded string to an audio file before an application can play it
- creates raw audio data of natural human speech
- access more than 180 voices across more than 30 languages in variants

#### DialogFlow
- used for building conversational interfaces
- analyze text or audio and respond to a human in a natural chatty way
- an authoring platform, not just an API, but it's possible to manage your chat bot through its API
