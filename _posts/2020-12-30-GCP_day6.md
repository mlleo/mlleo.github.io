#### Why Google
- There are over 4,000 Tensorflow machine learning modesls in production at Google

#### Why Google Cloud
- To be successful at ML, you need to think not just about creating models, but also about serving out ML predictions

- On GCP, the key services are all serverless and they're all managed infrastructure
- By building data pipelines in Google Cloud, you essentially get to take advantage of the **scalability, reliability, and sheer engineering progress that Google brings to running machine learning systems**![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103310750-aa9fa280-4a5b-11eb-9ac1-cc0a1f52f78d.png)

#### AI VS Machine Learning
- AI is a discipline, it has to do with the theory and methods to build machines think & act like humans
- Machine Learning is a toolset, so we can use machine learning to solve certain kinds of AI problems

#### Two stages of AI
1. Train an ML model with examples

2. Inference (Predict with a trained model)
