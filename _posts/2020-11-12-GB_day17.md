Error Analysis

#### Build your first system quickly, then iterate

Depending on the area of application, the guideline below will help you prioritize when you build your system.

- Guideline
  1. Set up development/test set and metrics
    - Set up a target
  2. Build an initial system quickly
    - Train training set quickly: Fit the parameters
    - Development set: Tune the parameters
    - Test set: Assess the performance
  3. Use bias/variance analysis & Error analysis to prioritize next steps
  
#### Training and testing on different distributions
