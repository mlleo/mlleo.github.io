#### What is Operating System

- A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware

#### Operating System goals
- Provide an environment to execute user programs(application programs)
- Make the computer system convenient to use
- Control the computer hardware in an efficient manner

#### Computer System Structure

Computer system can be divided into four components
- Hardware (CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc...)
- Operating System
- Appliction programs
- Users

- Operating system controls functions to use hardware so that application program could just use abstraction(READ, WRITE, etc...)

#### What Operating Systems Do
- Resource allocator
  - decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
- Control program
  - controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
- Control I/O devices and file system
<hr/>
***Core functionality of the operating system is kernel which manage all resources and control the abstraction of the hardware***

#### How does a computer operate? <br>

Booting
- Turn on the computer
- Bootsrap program is executed and the OS loaded to the memory
- Initialize all aspects of system (resource)

Bootstrap program (typically stored in ROM or EPROM) is a program for loading operating system to the memory

#### Computer system organization

One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common **bus** providing access to shared memory. <br>
Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing or memory cycles.
