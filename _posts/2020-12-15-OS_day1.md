#### What is Operating System

- A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware

#### Operating System goals
- Provide an environment to execute user programs(application programs)
- Make the computer system convenient to use
- Control the computer hardware in an efficient manner

#### Computer System Structure

Computer system can be divided into four components
- Hardware (CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc...)
- Operating System
- Appliction programs
- Users

- Operating system controls functions to use hardware so that application program could just use abstraction(READ, WRITE, etc...)

#### What Operating Systems Do
- Resource allocator
  - decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
- Control program
  - controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
- Control I/O devices and file system

***Core functionality of the operating system is kernel which manage all resources and control the abstraction of the hardware***
