#### What is Operating System

- A program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware

#### Operating System goals
- Provide an environment to execute user programs(application programs)
- Make the computer system convenient to use
- Control the computer hardware in an efficient manner

#### Computer System Structure

Computer system can be divided into four components
- Hardware (CPU, memory, I/O devices, etc...)
- Operating System
- Appliction programs
- Users

- Operating system controls functions to use hardware so that application program could just use abstraction(READ, WRITE, etc...)

#### What Operating Systems Do
- Resource allocator
  - decides between conflicting requests for efficient and fair resource use
- Control program
  - controls execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer
- Control I/O devices and file system

***Core functionality of the operating system is kernel which manage all resources and control the abstraction of the hardware***

#### How does a computer operate? <br>
![Booting_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/102245568-10127000-3f41-11eb-9e58-f08b7769b7ce.jpg)

Booting
- Turn on the computer
- Bootsrap program is executed and the OS loaded to the memory
- Initialize all aspects of system (resource)

Bootstrap program (typically stored in ROM or EPROM) is a program for loading operating system to the memory

#### Computer System Organization

One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common **bus** providing access to shared memory. <br>
Concurrent execution of CPUs and devices competing or memory cycles.

#### Computer System Operation
- I/O devices and the CPU can execute concurrently
- CPU moves data from/to main memory to/from local buffers
- I/O is from the device to local buffer of control
- Device controller informs CPU that it has finished its operation by **causing an interrupt**
![interrupt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/102251406-1a843800-3f48-11eb-8e3b-34bf9efe7769.png)

#### Common Functions of Interrupts
- Why interrupt occur?
  - Speed of I/O computations are much lower than the speed of CPU computations
  - To use CPU efficiently (OS don't want CPU to get some rest...), when I/O computations are done, then I/O device controller informs CPU by **Interrupt**
  - Interrput architecture should save the address of the interrupted instruction, so they save the address to the interrupt vector.
  
- Interrupt Process
  - Process A make interrupt
  - CPU store the present status (processes that CPU is controlling now) to PCB (Process Control Block)
  - Store the command to PC(Program Counter) which should be resumed after interrupt solved
  - Read Interrupt vector and get the addresses of ISR(Interrupt Service Routine)
  - Execute the first command of Interrupt
  - Interrupt solved
  - Come back to previous process by using addresses stored in PC(Program Counter)
  
#### Interrupt Handling

The operating system preserves the state of the CPU by storing registers and the program counter

cf. Polling : CPU manages all computations to check whether the target event occurred or not, which means that nothing could be done before the target event occurred

#### I/O Structure

Device controllers are used to transfer I/O data between the peripheral and device driver/operating system
- device driver loads appropriate registers within the device controller
- device controller determines the actions to take based on the register setting
- device controller starts transer of data between device and its buffer
- device controller informs device driver that the I/O transfer is over and the OS should take control of the system

#### Storage Structure
