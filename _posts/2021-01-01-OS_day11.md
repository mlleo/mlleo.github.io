#### Synchronization Background
- Processes can execute concurrently
- Concurrent access to shared data may result in ***data inconsistency*** (ex.multi-threads in a process OR multi-processes with shared memory)
- Maintaining data consistency requires mechanisms to ***ensure the orderly execution*** of cooperating processes

#### Synchronization Problem
- Two or more concurrent threads(or processes) accessing and manipulating a shared resource create a ***race condition***
- Race condition may lead to non-deterministic results
- OS is full of such a shared resource
- The output of the program is not deterministic, it varies from run to run even with same inputs, depending on timing
- Hard to debug... ("Heisenbugs...")

#### Critical Section
- A critical section is a piece of code that accesses a shared resource

- Need mutual exclusion for correct execution with critical sections
  - Execute the critical section atomically (all or nothing)
  - Only one thread at a time can execute in the critical section
  - All other threads are forced to wait on entry
  - When a thread leaves a critical section, another can enter

#### Locks
- An object (in memory) that provides mutual exclusion with the following two operations:
  - acquire() : wait until lock is free, then grab it
  - release() : unlock and wake up any thread waiting in acquire()
- Using locks
  - Lock is initially free
  - Call acquire() before entering a critical section, and release() after leaving it
  - acquire() does not return until the caller holds the lock
  - On acquire(), a thread can spin(spinlock) or block(mutex)
  - At most one thread can hold a lock at a time
