#### Operations in Processes
- Process creation
- Process termination
- Inter-process communication
- etc...

#### Process Creation
![hierarchy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/102809455-5cf4bb80-4405-11eb-9ab1-a6524819f344.JPG)

- A process (parent) can create another processes (children)
- Siblings are children with the same parent process
- Form a tree of processes
- Generally, process identified and managed via a process identiier (PID)
- Resource sharing options
  - Parent and children share all resources
  - Children share subset of parent's resources
  - Parent and child share no resources
- Execution options
  - Parent and children execute concurrently
  - Parent waits until children terminate
- fork()
  - Create a new process by cloning the current process (allocate memory)
  - Child duplicates the parent's address space
- exec()
  - System call used ater a fork() to replace the process' memory space with a new program
  - New process overwrite existed process (no more "existed process" exist)

- CPU scheduler decides which one to execute first between parent and child

#### Process Termination
- Process executes last statement and then asks the operating system to delete it using the **exit()** system call
  - Returns status data from child to parent via **wait()**
  - Parent process wait until child process dead
  - Process' resources are deallocated by operating system
- Parent may terminate the execution of children processes using the **abort()** system call
  - When child has exceeded allocated resources
  - When the task assigned to child is no longer required
  - When the parent is exiting and the operating system does not allow a child to continue if its parent terminates (**cascading termination**)
- Parent process may wait for termination of a child process by using the **wait()** system call
  - The call returns status information and the pid o the terminated process
  - pid = wait(&status)
  - A process which is terminated but parents its parent has not called wait() yet becomes **zombie**
  - If parent terminated without calling wait(), process is **orphan** (child is still alive)
  - Zombie and orphan process cause memory waste problem
  

#### Multiprocess Architecture (Chrome Browser)
- Many web browsers ran as single process
  - If one web site casues trouble, entire browser can be crashed
- Google Chrome Browser is multiprocess with 3 different types of processes
  - Browser, Renderer, Plug-in
  - But, waste memory resource problem


#### Schedulers
- Short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler)
  - selects which process should be executed next and allocates CPU
  - sometimes the only scheduler in a system
  - invoked frequently, so must be fast
- Long-term scheduler (job scheduler)
  - selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue
  - invoked infrequently, so may be slow
- Processes can be described as either:
  - I/O bound process: spends more time doing I/O than computations
  - CPU bound process: spends more time doing computations
  - Long-term schedulers strives for good process mix of I/O and CPU bound jobs(make all busy)
