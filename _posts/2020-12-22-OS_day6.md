#### Operations in Processes
- Process creation
- Process termination
- Inter-process communication
- etc...

#### Process Creation
![hierarchy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/102809455-5cf4bb80-4405-11eb-9ab1-a6524819f344.JPG)

- A process (parent) can create another processes (children)
- Siblings are children with the same parent process
- Form a tree of processes
- Generally, process identified and managed via a process identiier (PID)
- Resource sharing options
  - Parent and children share all resources
  - Children share subset of parent's resources
  - Parent and child share no resources
- Execution options
  - Parent and children execute concurrently
  - Parent waits until children terminate
- fork()
  - Create a new process by cloning the current process (allocate memory)
  - Child duplicates the parent's address space (but have different PCB)
- exec()
  - System call used ater a fork() to replace the process' memory space with a new program
  - New process overwrite existed process (no more "existed process" exist)

- CPU scheduler decides which one to execute first between parent and child

#### Process Termination
- Process executes last statement and then asks the operating system to delete it using the **exit()** system call
  - Returns status data from child to parent via **wait()**
  - Parent process wait until child process dead
  - Process' resources are deallocated by operating system
- Parent may terminate the execution of children processes using the **abort()** system call
  - When child has exceeded allocated resources
  - When the task assigned to child is no longer required
  - When the parent is exiting and the operating system does not allow a child to continue if its parent terminates (**cascading termination**)
- Parent process may wait for termination of a child process by using the **wait()** system call
  - The call returns status information and the pid o the terminated process
  - pid = wait(&status)
  - A process which is terminated but parents its parent has not called wait() yet becomes **zombie**
  - If parent terminated without calling wait(), process is **orphan** (child is still alive)
  - Zombie and orphan process cause memory waste problem
  

#### Multiprocess Architecture (Chrome Browser)
- Many web browsers ran as single process
  - If one web site casues trouble, entire browser can be crashed
- Google Chrome Browser is multiprocess with 3 different types of processes
  - Browser, Renderer, Plug-in
  - But, waste memory resource problem

#### Interprocess Communication
- Processe within a system may be independent or cooperating
- Independent processes cannot affect or be affected by the execution of another process
- Cooperating process can affect or be affected by other processes, including the procedure of **sharing data**
  - Information sharing
  - Computation speedup
  - Modularity
  - Convenience
- Cooperating processes need **Inter-process communication(IPC)**
  - Shared memory
  - Message passing
  
#### Communication Models
![ipc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103135691-544dff00-46fd-11eb-8968-407c6ae4b613.JPG)

#### Producer-Consumer problem
- Producer process produces information that is consumed by a consumer process
- Make sure that the producer does not overflow the buffer
- Make sure that the consumer does not pull from an empty bufer

#### Interprocess Communication - Shared Memory
- An area of memory shared among the processes that wish to communicate
- Pros
  - The communication is under the control of the users processes not the operating system
  - OS overhead not happen
- Cons
  - Synchronization problem when lots of processes access the shared memory

#### Interprocess Communication - Message Passing
- Mechanism for processes to communicate and to synchronize their actions
- Message system : processes communicate with eah other without resorting to shared variables
- Two operations
  - send(message)
  - receive(message)
- If processes P and Q wish to communicate, then
  - Establish a communication link between them
  - Exchange messages via send/receive

#### Direct Communication
- Processes must name each other explicitly
  - send(P, message) : send a message to process P
  - receive(Q, message) : receive a message from process Q
- Properties of communiation link
  - Links are established automatically
  - A link is associated with exactly one pair of communicating processes
  - Between each pair, there exist exactly one pair
  - The link may be undirectional, but is usually bi-directional
- Symmetric links
  - Both the sender and receiver specify the other partner
- Asymmetric links
  - Only the sender specifies the receiver
  
#### Indirect Communication
- Messages are directed and received from mailboxes
- Each mailbox has a unique id(POSIX message queues)
- Processes can communicate only if they share a mailbox
- send(A,message) : send a message to mailbox A
- receive(A,message) : receive a message from mailbox A
- Properties of communication link
  - Link established only if processes share a common mailbox
  - A link may be assoicated with many processes
  - Each pair of processes may share several communication links
  - Link may be unidirectional or bi-directional

#### Synchronization
- Message passing may be either blocking or non-bloking
- Blocking (synchronous)
  - Blocking send : the sender is blocked until the message is received
  - Blocking receive : the receiver is blocked until a message is available
- Non-Blocking (asynchronous)
  - Non-Blocking send : the sender sends the message and continue
  - Non-Bloking receive : the receiver receives a valid message or null

#### Communication in Client-Server systems
- Shared memory
- Message passing
- Sockets
- Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)

#### Sockets
- A socket is defined as an endpoint for communication
- Concatenation of IP address and port
- The socket 161.25.19.8:1625 refers to port 1625 on host 161.25.19.8
- Communication consists between a pair of sockets
- All ports below 1024 are well known, used for standard services
- Specia IP address 127.0.0.1 to refer to system on which process is running
- Three types of sockets
  - Connection-oriented (TCP)
  - Connectionless (UDP)
  - MulticastSocket class

#### Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
- abstracts procedure calls between processes on **networked systems**
- Stubs : client-side proxy that abstracts the actual procedure
- The client-side stub locates the server and packaging parameters into a form for transmission on network
- The server-side stub receives this message, unpacks parameters and performs the procedure on the server
![rpc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103157543-20ef9b00-47f7-11eb-853e-2a7e7b7972cd.JPG)

#### Pipes
- Ordinary pipes
  - cannot be accessed from outside the process that created it
  - Typically, a parent process creates a pipe and uses it to communiate with a child process that it created
  - allow communication in standard producer-consumer style
  - Producer writes to one end (the **write-end** of the pipe)
  - Consumer reads from the other end(the **read-end** of the pipe)
  - Unidirectional
  - Require parent-child relationship between communicating processes
  ![pipe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103157467-6e1f3d00-47f6-11eb-9614-d388ebbe4d52.JPG)

- Named pipes
  - can be accessed without a parent-child relationship
  - more powerful than ordinary pipes
  - Bidirectional
  - No parent-child relationship is necessary
  - Several processes can use the named pipe for communication
  - stay alive even after process terminates
