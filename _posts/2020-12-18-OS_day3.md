#### Operating System Services

Operating systems provide an environment for execution of programs and services to programs and users. <br>
One set of operating system services provides functions that are helpful to the user
- User Interface : CLI, GUI, etc...
- Program execution 
  - load a program into memory and run that program
  - end execution, either normally or abnormally.
- I/O operations
  - A running program may require I/O, which may involve a file or an I/O device
- File-system manipulation
  - Programs need to create, delete, read and write files and directories
  - search, list file information, and permission management
- Communications
  - Processes may exchange information on the same computer or between computers over a network
  - Communications may be via shared memory or through **message passing** (packets moved by the OS)
- Error detection
  - OS needs to be constantly aware of possible errors
  - May occur in the CPU and memory hardware, in I/O devices, in user program
  - Take the appropriate action to ensure correct and consistent computing
  - Debugging facilities can greatly enhance the user's and programmer's abilities to efficiently use the system
- Resource allocation
  - When multiple users or multiple jobs running concurrently, resources must be allocated to each of them
- Accounting
  - To keep track of which users use how much and what kinds of computer resources
- Protection and Security
  - Protection involves ensuring that all access to system resources is controlled
  - Security of the system from outsiders requires user authentication, extends to defending external I/O devices from invalid access attempts

#### System Calls

- Mostly accessed by programs via a high-level Application Programming Interface (API) rather than direct system call use
- 3 most common APIs are Win32 API for Windows, POSIX API for POSIX-based systems, and Java API for the JVM(Java Virtual Machine)

#### Example of System Calls

#### Examples of Windows and Unix System Calls

#### Standard C library Example
- C program invoking printf() library call, which calls write() system call

#### System Call Parameter Passing
Often, more information is required than simply the identity of the desired system call. <br>
Exact type and amount of information vary according to OS and call type. <br>
Three general methods used to pass parameters to the OS
1. Pass the parameters in registers 
  - Problem: limited number of registers
2. Parameters stored in a block, or table in memory and address of block passesd as a parameter in a register (Pointer passsing)
3. Parameters are placed, or pushed onto the stack by the program and popped off the stack by the OS.
