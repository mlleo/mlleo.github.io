#### Computer-System Architecture

- Single-processor
- Multi-processor (parallel systems)
  1. Increased throughput
  2. Economy of scale : shared common resources
  3. Increased reliability : if one CPU have problem, then other CPU can do the task
  - Assymmetric Multiprocessing : each processor is assianed a task
  - Symmetric Multiprocessing : each processor performs all tasks

- Multi-core : communicate within one chip, so faster than Multi-processor

#### Operating System Structure
- Multiprogramming (Batch System) : needed for efficiency
  - Single user cannot keep CPU and I/O devices busy ata ll times
  - Multiprogramming organizes jobs so CPU always has one to execute
  - A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory
  - One job selected and run via **job scheduling**
  - When it has to wati(ex.I/O interrupt), OS switches to another job.
- Timesharing(multitasking) : CPU switches jobs **so frequently** that users can interact with each job while it is running
  - Several users use 1 CPU
  - Response time should be < 1 second
  - Each user has at least one program executing in memory (process)
  - If several jobs are ready to run at the same time, Os schedules CPU (CPU scheduling)
  
  #### Operating System Operations
  - Interrupt driven
    - Hardware interrupt (by one of the devices) : occurs asynchronously (at any time)
    - Software interrupt (exception or trap)
      - Software error (ex. division by zero)
      - Request for operating system device
      - Other process problems include infinite loop, processes modifying each other in the OS
    - Exception : synchronous interrupts, generated by CPU at the end of the instruction
    - Trap : kind of exception typically with the purpose of debugging
  - Dual mode
    - Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itsef and other system components
    - User mode (mode bit : 1)
    - Kernel mode (mode bit : 0)
    - Mode bit is provided by hardware
      - provides ability to distinguish when system is running user code or kernel code
      - some instructions designated as privileged, only executable in kernel mode
      - system call changes mode to kernel, return from call resets it to user
