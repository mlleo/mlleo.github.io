Sequence Models

#### Examples of Sequence problem
- Speech recognition
- Music generation
- Sentiment classification
- DNA sequence analysis
- Machine translation
- Video activity recognition
- Name entity recognition
- etc...

#### Notation example in Named-entity recognition problem

#### How to represent words
- Based on words dictionary, use one-hot encoding
- Assume dictionary have 10,000 words which means 100 dimensional vector. (Most case dictionary size = 30,000 ~50,000)
- Then every words will be represented to 100 dimensional vector (one-hot encoding)
- Goal is that given this representation for X to learn a mapping using a sequence model to then target output y

#### Why not use standard network?

Problems
  - Inputs, outputs can be different lengths in different examples.
  - Doesn't share features learned across different positions of text.
  
#### Recurrent Neural Networks

Limitation : the prediction at a certain time uses information from the inputs earlier in the sequence but not information later in the sequence.

#### RNN forward propagation

#### Simplified RNN forward propagation notation
