Convolutions over volumes

#### Multiple filters


#### Example of 1-layer ConvNet


#### Summary of Notation
- Assume layer l is a convolution layer

#### Example of ConvNet

Types of layer in convolutional neural network
- Convolution (Conv)
- Pooling (POOL)
- Fully Connected (FC)

#### Pooling layer
- Max Pooling (if 3D, then max pooling computation is done independently on each of channels)

- Average Pooling (not often used)
