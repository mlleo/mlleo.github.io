GB(Google Bootcamp) series is based on the coursera lecture **"Deep Learning Specialization".**
These posts are for my review of basic machine learning, but I also hope that it could be helpful for others.<br><br>

- If you've done coursera lecture "Deep Learning Specialization", then it would be perfect for you to remind. <br>
- If you studied basic machine learning before, it could be nice to wrap up your knowledge. <br>
- If you haven't studied basic machine learning before, then I recommend you to use this blog posts as supplementary materials with **other full-organized materials(books, lectures, etc.)**

Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Supervised Learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problem.
