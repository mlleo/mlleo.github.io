#### Process
- An instance of program in execution
  - Program becomes process when executable file loaded into memory
- Program is passive entity stored on disk, process is active 
- One program can become several processes (consider multiple users executing the same program)
- Each process is identified using its process ID (PID)

#### From program to process

- Each process has its own address space in memory 
- The program **code**, also called text section
  - A register called Program Counter(PC) points to the instruction that is currently executing
- **Data** section containing global variables
- **Stack** containing temporary data
  - Function parameters, return addresses, local variables
  - Pointed by Stack Pointer (SP) register
- **Heap** containing memory dynamically allocated during run time

#### Process State

As a process executes, it changes **state**
- new : The process is being created ( by fork() )
- running : Instructions are being executed 
- waiting : The process is waiting for some event to occur ( queue )
- ready : The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor ( queue )
- terminated : The process has finished execution

#### Process Control Block (PCB)

- Information associated with each process (also called task control block)
- Each PCB represents a process

- Process state : running, waiting, etc ...
- Program counter : location of the instruction to execute next
- CPU registers : contents of all process
- CPU scheduling information : priorities, scheduling queue pointers, etc ...
- Memory managment information : memory allocated to the process
- Accounting information : CPU used, clock time, etc ...
- I/O status information : I/O devices allocated to process, list of open files, etc ...

#### Context Switch
- Context of a process represented in the PCCB
- When CPU switches to another process, the system must **save the state** of the old process and load the saved state for the new process using a **context switch**
- The system does no useful work while switching
- The more complex OS and the PCB, the longer the context switch (longer latency)
- Time dependent on hardware support

#### CPU switch

- Cpu do nothing while context switching

#### Threads (detail in CH4)
- Process has a single thread of execution
- All program have at least one thread
- Multiple threads
  - operate independently
  - program counter(PC) exist per thread
  - 1 PCB exist (1 process)

#### Process Scheduling
- Goal : Maximize CPU use, quickly switch processes onto CPU for time sharing
- Process scheduler selects among available processes for next execution on CPU
- Maintains scheduling queues of processes
  - Job queue : set of all processes in the system
  - Ready queue : set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute
  - Device queue : set of processes waiting or an I/O device

#### Schedulers
- Short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler)
  - selects which process should be executed next and allocates CPU
  - sometimes the only scheduler in a system
  - invoked frequently, so must be fast
- Long-term scheduler (job scheduler)
  - selects which processes should be brought into the ready queue
  - invoked infrequently, so may be slow
- Processes can be described as either:
  - I/O bound process: spends more time doing I/O than computations
  - CPU bound process: spends more time doing computations
  - Long-term schedulers strives for good process mix of I/O and CPU bound jobs(make all busy)
- Medium-term scheduler (multiple programming)
  - Remove process from memory, store on disk, bring back in from disk to continue execution (swapping)
