#### Process
- An instance of program in execution
  - Program becomes process when executable file loaded into memory
- Program is passive entity stored on disk, process is active 
- One program can become several processes (consider multiple users executing the same program)
- Each process is identified using its process ID (PID)

#### From program to process

- Each process has its own address space in memory 
- The program **code**, also called text section
  - A register called Program Counter(PC) points to the instruction that is currently executing
- **Data** section containing global variables
- **Stack** containing temporary data
  - Function parameters, return addresses, local variables
  - Pointed by Stack Pointer (SP) register
- **Heap** containing memory dynamically allocated during run time

#### Process State

As a process executes, it changes **state**
- new : The process is being created
- running : Instructions are being executed
- waiting : The process is waiting for some event to occur
- ready : The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
- terminated : The process has finished execution






#### Operations in Processes
- Process creation
- Process termination
- Inter-process communication
- etc...

#### Process Creation

- A process (parent) can create another processes (children)
- Siblings are children with the same parent process
- Form a tree of processes
- Generally, process identified and managed via a process identiier (PID)
- Resource sharing options
  - Parent and children share all resources
  - Children share subset of parent's resources
  - Parent and child share no resources
- Execution options
  - Parent and children execute concurrently
  - Parent waits until children terminate
- fork()
  - Create a new process by cloning the current process (allocate memory)
  - Child duplicates the parent's address space
- exec()
  - System call used ater a fork() to replace the process' memory space with a new program
  - New process overwrite existed process (no more "existed process" exist)
