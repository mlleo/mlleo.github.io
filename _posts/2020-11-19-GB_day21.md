Convolutional Neural Networks2

#### Why convolutions?
- parameter sharing :
  A feature detector that's useful in one part of the image is probably useful in another part of the image
- sparsity of connections :
  In each layer, each output value depends only on a small number of inputs

#### Training process (same as standard nn)


#### LeNet-5


#### AlexNet


#### VGG-16
