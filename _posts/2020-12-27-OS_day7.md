#### Motivation for threads
- Problem
  - A single process cannot benefit from multi-cores
  - Very cucmberome to write a program with many cooperating processes
  - Expensive to create a new process
  - High communication overheads between processes
  - Expensive contect swithching between processes
- What if separate out a process's **execution state** from others
  - Process: address space, resources, other general process attributes(e.g. user ID, privileges, ...)
  - Execution state: PC, SP, registers, etc...
- Such an execution state is usually called **a thread**

#### Thread
- A thread executes a sequence of instructions in a program
- Single-threaded process
  - has one program counter specifying location of next instrution to execute
  - process executes instructions sequentially, one at a time, until completion
- Multi-threaded process
  - has one program counter per thread
- Threads **share an address space**
  - Code
  - Global variables
  - Heap
  - Opened files
- A thread **has its own**
  - Set of registers including PC & SP
  - Stack
  - Thread ID
