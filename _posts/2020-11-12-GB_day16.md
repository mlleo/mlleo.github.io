ML strategy 2

#### Human-level performance
Some of the tasks that humans do are close to "perfection" which is why machine learning tries to mimic human-level performance. The graph below shows the performance of humans and machine learning over time.

Machine learning progresses slowly when it surpasses human-level performance. One of the reason is that **human-level performance can be close to Bayes optimal error**, especially for natural perception problem. Bayes optimal error is defined as the best possible error. In other words, it means that any functions mapping from x to y can't surpass a certain level of accuracy. Other reason is that when the performance of machine learning is worse than the performance of humans, you can improve it with different tools. **They are harder to use once it surpasses human-level performance.** <br><br>

These tools are get labeld data from humans, gain insight rom manual error analysis, better analysis of bias/variance

#### Avoidable bias
