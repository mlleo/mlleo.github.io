Recommending Products using Cloud SQL and Spark

### Google Cloud Products
1. Cloud SQL - manged relational database
2. Cloud dataproc - managed environment on which you can run Apache Spark

### Why we migrate an on-premise application to Google Cloud platform?
1. to avoid the challenges that are associated with utilizing and tuning on-premise clusters.
2. when you move an on-premise application to Google Cloud, you're also moving from dedicated storage to off-cluster storage with Google Cloud Storage.

### The core pieces of a recommendation system

Hand-coded rules are hard to maintain. <br>

Why can't we train a machine learning model to basically provide a ranking of these links? <br>
That's exactly what Google itself did internally with a deep learning model called Rank Brain.

***Machine Learning = exmaples, not rules***
