#### Types of Semaphores
- Binary semaphore (mutex)
  - Semaphore value is initialized to 1
  - Guarantee mutually exclusive access to resource
- Counting semaphore
  - Semaphore value is initialized to N
  - Represent a resource with many units available
  - Allow threads to enter as long as some units are available

#### Classical Problems of Synchronization
- Bounded-buffer problem
- Reader and writers problem
- Dining-philosophers problem

#### Bounded buffer Problem (Producer /  consumer problem)
-  There is a set of resource buffers shared by producers and consumers
-  Producers insert resources into the buffer
-  Consumers remove resources from the buffer
-  Producers and consumers execute at different rates

- No synchronization case

- Using mutex or semaphore case

#### Readers-Writers Problem

- Sharing resource among multiple readers and writers
  - An object is shared among several threads
  - Some threads only read the object, others only write it
  - We can allow ***multiple readers*** at a time
  - We can only allow ***one writer*** at a time
 
- Implementation with semaphores
  - readcount : # of threads reading object
  - mutex : control access to readcount
  - rw : exclusive writing or reading

- If there is a writer
  - The first reader blocks on rw
  - All other readers will then block on mutex
- Once a writer exits, all readers can fall through
  - Which reader gets to go first?
- The last reader to exit signals waiting writer
  - Can new readers get in while writer is waiting?
- When a writer exits, if there is both a reader and writer waiting, which one goes next is up to scheduler


#### Dining Philosophers Problem

- Each philosopher repeats forever:
  - Thinking
  - Pick up two forks (chopsticks) -> left first, if can't then wait
  - Eating
  - Put down two forks (chopsticks)

- Deadlock occur
  - Mutual Exclusion : A chopstick can be used by one philosopher at a time
  - Hold and wait : Philosophers hold one chopstick and wait for the other
  - No preemption : Nobody can take other's chopsticks
  - Circular wait : All philosopher wait for their right-side chopstick
