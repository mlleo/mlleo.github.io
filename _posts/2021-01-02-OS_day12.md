#### Types of Semaphores
- Binary semaphore (mutex)
  - Semaphore value is initialized to 1
  - Guarantee mutually exclusive access to resource
- Counting semaphore
  - Semaphore value is initialized to N
  - Represent a resource with many units available
  - Allow threads to enter as long as some units are available

#### Classical Problems of Synchronization
- Bounded-buffer problem
- Reader and writers problem
- Dining-philosophers problem

#### Bounded buffer Problem (Producer /  consumer problem)
-  There is a set of resource buffers shared by producers and consumers
-  Producers insert resources into the buffer
-  Consumers remove resources from the buffer
-  Producers and consumers execute at different rates

- No synchronization case

- Using mutex or semaphore case

#### Readers-Writers Problem

- Sharing resource among multiple readers and writers
  - An object is shared among several threads
  - Some threads only read the object, others only write it
  - We can allow ***multiple readers*** at a time
  - We can only allow ***one writer*** at a time
 
- Implementation with semaphores
  - readcount : # of threads reading object
  - mutex : control access to readcount
  - rw : exclusive writing or reading
