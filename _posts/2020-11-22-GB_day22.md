Convolutional Neural Network3

#### 1 * 1 convolutions



#### Practical Advice
- Use open-source implementations
- Use Transer Learning
  - Freeze pre-trained model and train last few layers that you want to target
  - If dataset = large, freeze few layers then train others
  - If dataset = very large, initialize weights with pre-trained weights, then train the whole pre-trained model
- Data Augmentation
  - Mirroring on the vertical axis
  - Random cropping
  - Color Shifting
  - Rotation
  - Shearing
  - Local Warping
