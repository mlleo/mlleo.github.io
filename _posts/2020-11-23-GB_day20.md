Object Detection

#### Object localization
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103161436-219f2600-4825-11eb-85e7-fe77ec7a3688.png)

#### Define the target label y

#### Landmark Detection
- Labels have to be consistent across the different images

#### Sliding windows detection
- Pass lots of little cropped images into the ConvNet and have it classified zero or one for each position
- Problem : computation cost

#### Implementation of sliding windows
- Turning FC layer into Convolutional layers

- Convolution implementation

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103161587-72178300-4827-11eb-8df1-78a17357e066.png)

- crop out a region
- Repeat run cropped image to your ConvNet until recognizes the object
- Instead of doing it sequentially, implement the entire image, all maybe 28 by 28 and convolutionally make all the predictions at the same time by one forward pass
- Problem : the position of the bounding boxes is not going to be too accurate (none of the bounding boxes match exactly)



#### Intersection over Union (IoU)
- Generally, IoU is a measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes
- Evaluation for object localization task
![iou](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103161690-ff0f0c00-4828-11eb-850c-ba56653c3a07.png)

#### Non-max Suppression
- Non-max suppression is a way for you to make sure that your algorithm detects each object only once
- What non-max suppression does is that it cleans up all detections, so they end up with just one detection per car, rather than multiple detections per car

![ex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62474292/103188029-1eca3100-490a-11eb-8879-1a80d06d1a7d.png)

- Disard all boxes with Pc <= 0.6 (threshold)
- While there are any remaining boxes
  - Pick the box with the largest Pc, then output that as a prediction
  - Discard any remaining box with IoU >= 0.5 (threshold) with the box output in the previous step
  
#### Anchor boxes


#### YOLO algorithm

#### Region proposal
- R-CNN
  - Idea : Rather than running sliding windows on every single window, you instead select just a few windows and run your classifier on just a few windows (segementation algorithm applied in order to figure out in which windows could be objeccts)
  - Propose regions
  - Classify proposed regions one at a time
  - Output label + bounding box

- Fast R-CNN
  - Propose regions
  - Use convolution implementation of sliding windows to classify all the proposed regions
- Faster R-CNN
  - Use convolutional network to propose regions
