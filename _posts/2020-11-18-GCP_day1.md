Introduction to the Data and Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform Specialization

### Big Data Challenges
1. Migrating existing data workloads(ex. Hadoop, Spark jobs)
2. Analyzing large datasets at scale
3. Building streaming data pipelines
4. Applying machine learning to your data

### Background of Google Cloud Platform
- Google had to develop the infrastructure to ingest, manage, and serve all the data from applications (google map, gmail, android, ... etc.)
- Google's mission : Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful

### Four fundamental aspects of Google's core infrastructure

### 1. Compute Power
- Google trains on its infrastructure and deploys ML to phone hardware
- Leverage Google's AI research with pre-trained AI building blocks

### 2. Storage
- One major way that Cloud Computing differs from desktop computing is that "Compute" and "Storage" are independent
Storage Class

All class have multi-region, dual-region, and region location options.<br>
They differ based on the access speed and the cost.

### Demo : Creating a VM on Compute Engine
1. Create VM instances
2. Compute
3. Create bucket for storage
4. Copy files to bucket
5. Delte / Stop VM instances
6. Enable to change the permission of data

### Compute
- Compute Engine 
  - Google's IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) solution
  - provides maximum flexibility for people who prefer to manage server instances themselves
- GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine)
  - Clusers of machines running containers
  - enables to run containerized applications in a cloud environment
  - Kubernetes is a way to orchestrate code that's running in containers
- App Engine
  - GCP's fully managed PaaS (Platform as a Service) framework
  - used for long-livedd web applications
- Cloud Functions 
  - completely serverless execution environment
  - FaaS (Function as a Service)
  - used for code that's triggered by an event such as a new file hitting cloud storage
  
### Storage
GCP offers relational and non-relational databases and worldwide object storage
- Cloud Bigtable
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud SQL
- Cloud Spanner
- Cloud Datastore
  
### Big Data
GCP offers fully managed big data and machien learning services

## Case Study
1. What were the barriers or challenges the customer faced?
2. How were these challenges solved with a cloud solution? What products did they use?
3. What was the business impact?
