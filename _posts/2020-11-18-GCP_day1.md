Introduction to the Data and Machine Learning on Google Cloud Platform Specialization

### Big Data Challenges
1. Migrating existing data workloads(ex. Hadoop, Spark jobs)
2. Analyzing large datasets at scale
3. Building streaming data pipelines
4. Applying machine learning to your data

### Background of Google Cloud Platform
- Google had to develop the infrastructure to ingest, manage, and serve all the data from applications (google map, gmail, android, ... etc.) => billions of users
- Google's mission : Organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful

### Four fundamental aspects of Google's core infrastructure

### 1. Compute Power
- Google trains on its infrastructure and deploys ML to phone hardware
- Leverage Google's AI research with pre-trained AI building blocks

### 2. Storage
- One major way that Cloud Computing differs from desktop computing is that "Compute" and "Storage" are independent.
- Getting your data from VM instances into your solution and transforming it for your purposes.
- Data engineers should build data pipelines before they can start building machine learning models from the data.<br><br>

Storage Class

All class have multi-region, dual-region, and region location options.<br>
They differ based on the access speed and the cost.

- The organization is the root node of the entire GCP hierarchy. (necessary for folders, set all policies)
- Project is a base-level organizing entity for creating and using resources and services.
- Enable to collaborate with many other teams in the organization across many projects.
- Cloud Identity and Access Management (IM / IAM) fine-tune access control of all GCP resources by IAM policies.

### 3. Networking
- Google's private network carries as much as 40% of the worlds' Internet traffic every day.
- Google's data center network speed enables the separation of compute and storage.

### 4. Security

- Communications to Google Cloud are encrypted in transit (multiple layers of security)
- Stored data is encrypted at rest and distributed
#### BigQuery
- BigQuery table data encrypted with keys (and those keys are also encrypted)
- Monitor and flag queries for anomalous behavior
- Limit data access with authorized views.

### Demo : Creating a VM on Compute Engine
1. Create VM instances
2. Compute
3. Create bucket for storage
4. Copy files to bucket
5. Delte / Stop VM instances
6. Enable to change the permission of data

### Compute
- Compute Engine 
  - Google's IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) solution
  - provides maximum flexibility for people who prefer to manage server instances themselves
- GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine)
  - Clusers of machines running containers
  - enables to run containerized applications in a cloud environment
  - Kubernetes is a way to orchestrate code that's running in containers
  - Containerization is a way to package code that's designed to be highly portable and to use resources very efficiently
- App Engine
  - GCP's fully managed PaaS (Platform as a Service) framework
  - just focus on your code and let Google deal with all the provisioning and resource management
  - used for long-livedd web applications
- Cloud Functions 
  - completely serverless execution environment
  - FaaS (Function as a Service)
  - used for code that's triggered by an event such as a new file hitting cloud storage
  
### Storage
1. GCP offers relational and non-relational databases and worldwide object storage
2. GCP storage reduces the work it takes to store different kinds of data
- Cloud Bigtable
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud SQL
- Cloud Spanner
- Cloud Datastore
  
### Big Data
GCP offers fully managed big data and machien learning services

### Big data products on Google Cloud Platform

## Case Study
1. What were the barriers or challenges the customer faced?
2. How were these challenges solved with a cloud solution? What products did they use?
3. What was the business impact?

### Key roles in a data-driven organization
A common mistake that companies make is that they go out and hire 10 PhD machine learning scientists, and expect magic to happen.
They focus on the ML researchers, and forget about all the help and guidance that the ML researchers will need.
#### Big data roles

- **data engineers** to build the pipelines and get you clean data.<br>
- **Decision makers**, to decide how deep you want to invest in a data-driven opportunity while weighing the benefits for the organization.<br>
- **Analysts**, to explore the data for insights and potential relationships that could be useful as features in a machine learning model.<br>
- **Statisticians**, to help make your data-inspired decisions become true data-driven decisions, with their added rigor.<br>
- **Applied machine learning engineers**, who have real-world experience building production machine learning models from the latest and best information and research by the researchers.<br>
- **Data scientists**, who have the mastery over analysis, statistics, and machine learning.<br>
- **Analytics** managers to lead the team.<br>
- **Social scientists and ethicists** to ensure that the quantitative impact is there for your project and, it's the right thing to do.
